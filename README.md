# MovieLens-Satistical-Leanring-Project

The goal of this project is to explore different supervised satistical learning methods and models in order to comprehensivly understand how they work. I decided to analyze the MovieLense data set from Kaggle to see how accuratly certian models could predict the average IMBD movie rating of a movie given the year the movie was made, number of ratings, average rating, and 19 different movie generas. 

About the data:
The MovieLense data set is comprised of 100,836 ratings applied to 9,742  movies rated by 610 users, encompassing 19 genres. the generas included are, Action, Adventure, Animation, Children, Comedy, Crime, Documentary, Drama, Fantasy, Film-Noir, Horror, Musical, Mystery, Romance, Sci-Fi, Thriller, War, Western, no genres listed. The data was collected from March 29th, 1996 to September 24th 2018. the users used for this data set must have rated more than 20 movies on IMBD in order to be included in the dataset. No demographic information was taken about the user, only their unique user ID number was used.
